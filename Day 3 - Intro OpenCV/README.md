# OpenCV Minicourse

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. So, here is shown the basic use of OpenCV, focusing on the object recognition task.

## Lessons

### [Lesson 01 - Introduction](https://github.com/cs-ufrn/minicourse-opencv/blob/master/OpenCV%20-%20Introduction.ipynb)

This notebook covers the introduction of OpenCV, talking about reading and writing images, color spaces, pixels manipulation and drawing. 

### [Lesson 02 - Image Processing](https://github.com/cs-ufrn/minicourse-opencv/blob/master/OpenCV%20-%20Image%20Processing.ipynb)

This notebook shows simple transformations, like cropping, mirroring, rotation and resizing, besides of logic and arithmetic operation and masking.  

### [Lesson 03 - Intermediate Topics](https://github.com/cs-ufrn/minicourse-opencv/blob/master/OpenCV%20-%20Convolutions%2C%20Histogram%20and%20Thresholding.ipynb)

This lesson introduce the idea of convolution into images, histograms and thresholding.

### [Lesson 04 - Detection and Classification of Objects](https://github.com/cs-ufrn/minicourse-opencv/blob/master/OpenCV%20-%20Object%20Detection%20and%20Classification.ipynb)

The last lesson addresses detection of objects using Haar Cascade and the segmentation of objects using adaptive thresholding and connected components.

### [Lesson 05 - Project Suggestions](https://github.com/cs-ufrn/minicourse-opencv/blob/master/OpenCV%20V%20-%20Project%20Suggestions.ipynb)

This notebook has some suggestions of projects to practice.
